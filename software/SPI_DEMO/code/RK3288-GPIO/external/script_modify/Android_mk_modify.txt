in order to control the power pin in the adb command
add the following code into the Android.mk
line17:
LOCAL_SRC_FILES += device/printer_powerctl/led.c

line174-line179:
include $(CLEAR_VARS)
LOCAL_C_INCLUDES := $(LOCAL_PATH)/device/include
LOCAL_SRC_FILES :=  bin/printer_powerctl/main.c

LOCAL_SHARED_LIBRARIES := libpaxdevice
LOCAL_LDLIBS := -llog 
LOCAL_MODULE := printer_powerctl_test
include $(BUILD_EXECUTABLE)

after add this code,we can debug in adb with the command printer_powerctl_test
